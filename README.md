It is used to modify the atom type of data exported from lammps, and change all atoms to one type of atom.                                 
#Tool 2
Processing atomic velocity files output by lammps, that is, remove the periodic header of the velocity file.                               
#Tool 3                                                                                                                                   
write MoS2-MoSe2 data file for ovito, eigen_vector(eigenvectorfile from GULP, primitive cell file, data for ovitio, atom number of primitive cell)
